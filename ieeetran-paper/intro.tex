\section{Introduction}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.7 and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
I wish you the best of success.
